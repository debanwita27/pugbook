# Plan

1. Back end:
    - Set up a basic server with Node.js and express [X]
    - Create a database in MongoDB/Firebase/MariaDB/NeDB [x]
    - Populate the database with dummy data generated by a script [x]
    - Now fetch items from the database in the server. [x]
    - Serve items from the database from the server. [x]
    - Add `Mahato` table to the database [x]
    - Make GET requests to the server using curl/thunderbird/postman/browser [x]
2. Front end:
    - Make `GET` requests to the server instead of `dog.ceo` and `fakename` APIs. [x]
    - Add a dummy user that can post comments (but the comments are not passed to the backend) [x]
3. Backend:
    - Add tables representing:
        - User 
        - Comment 
    - Add endpoints for:
        - Log-in  
        - Post comment
