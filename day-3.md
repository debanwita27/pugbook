- Used `props`
- Made Mahato Bloodline Viewer

# Plan

1. Back end:
    - Set up a basic server with Node.js and express [X]
    - Create a database in MongoDB/Firebase/MariaDB/NeDB [x]
    - Populate the database with dummy data generated by a script [x]
    - Now fetch items from the database in the server. [x]
    - Serve items from the database from the server. [x]
    - Add `Mahato` table to the database [x]
    - Make GET requests to the server using curl/thunderbird/postman/browser [x]
2. Front end:
    - Make `GET` requests to the server instead of `dog.ceo` and `fakename` APIs. [x]
    - Add a dummy user that can post comments (but the comments are not passed to the backend) [x]
3. Backend:
    - Add tables representing:
        - User [ ]
        - Comment [ ]
    - Create an end-point in the express backend to add a user to the database. [ ]
    - Test the end-point with Postman. [ ]
    - Add a sign-up form on the webpage.[ ]
    - When a user fills in the sign-up form, and clicks the sign-up button,
      Add a user to the DB.[ ]
    - Server-side username and password validation (both must be strings, password must at least have N characters, etc.). [ ]
        - What should the status code be whtn the username/password is invalid? [ ]
    - Client side validation (both fields are required, password must have at least 1 lowercase and 1 uppercase letter, 1 special character and a number. Must at least be 6 characters long). [ ]
    - Add endpoints for:
        - Log-in
        - Post comment
